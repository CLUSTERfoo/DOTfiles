(Xmonad related instructions from the old readme)

#### Install Desktop Environment (Linux)

This is the location in Ubuntu. I don't know if
other systems are the same. You might require sudo:

        $ sudo ln ~/DOTfiles/xmonad-custom.desktop /usr/share/xsessions/xmonad-custom.desktop

This will create a new Xmonad login session that you can choose from in the 
Ubuntu login screen dropdown.
